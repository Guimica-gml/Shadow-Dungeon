# Shadow-Dungeon
A dungeon crawler made in GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
You can download the game for windows in my [itch.io](https://guimica.itch.io/shadow-dungeon) page, there's no web version available.

## Game concept
This game was created in a week for a gamejam with the theme 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'.
The whole idea of the game is that when you recieve damage your weapon gains one level (making it stronger),
obviously you also lose 1 hp. The game contains a variety of guns, items and enemies, which will be listed later.
As the name implies the game is placed in a dungeon, which is composed by three floors and a final boss room.

## Gameplay
The basic gameplay consists of the player going from room to room in the dungeon killing the enemies with guns that can
be found in chests spread through the map. The default weapon, for when the player in not holding a gun, is a knife.
As described, every time the player is hit its gun gains 1 level point, the player can then regain hp by founding the heart item
(described in the `Items` section). To avoid having the player getting too strong, it will lose a level point 
in its gun every time it gets an item, the only expection being ammunition.

There are three levels, they are all very small, the game itself can be completed in less than 5 minutes,
the last room contains a boss, with three different attacks that are chosen randomly.

This was my first ever complete game, even though it's very small and a lot of the game design does not work,
it was a good practice for any future games.

## Weapons
The guns don't have an specif name in game, but they basically are:
- Knife (when you don't have a gun)
- Pistol
- Deagle
- Machine gun
- Sniper
- Shotgun

There are differences between the guns, but nothing so different of what you would expect them to do.
They have varied recoil and damage, but because of them game design and how they are balanced the difference between them is hard to feel.

## Items
The items also don't have specif in game names, but they are:
- Boots: increases your speed each time you get one
- Heart: increases your hp by 1 point (you cannot get it if your health is full)
- Ammunition: gives you one cartridge for your current gun (you cannot get it if not holding a gun)

All items decrease your gun level by 1 point, only exception being the ammunition.

## Enemies
The enemies _also_ don't have in game names, but they are:
- Bats: just chases you
- Slimes: just chases you, but when killed, it creates two smaller (and weaker) versions of itself
- Ghosts: runs away from you while shooting
