# Shadow-Dungeon
A dungeon crawler made in GameMaker Studio 2<br>
It contains three levels, different enemies and wapons and a final boss<br>
It's a very short game that I created in a week for a game jame<br>
If you want to play the game you can download it in my [itch.io](https://guimica.itch.io/shadow-dungeon) page<br>
There's no web version available
